# Emotion Gesture Compiler
it's a combination of the [EmotionDetector](https://github.com/lucasboscatti/EmotionDetection/tree/main/train) made by Boscatti and the GestureDetector made by Guilherme. It intends to faster the train data aquisition using the emotion of the user to determine if the record is either accepted or discarted.

# Emotion Detection
There are 3 types of recognizable emotions: Good, Bad and Neutral. The first one confirms that the record is valid to enter the dataBase, the second discards the result and the last one does nothing to the data.

# Gesture Detection
There are 5 gestures labeled A, B, C, D and E. The record starts with the rise of the user left hand
